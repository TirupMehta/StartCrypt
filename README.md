## How it Works? 
The tool primarily uses ROT13 encryption combined with Base64 encoding for the encryption and decryption process. Here's how it works:

### 1. Custom Encryption (customEncrypt):

It shifts each alphabetical character by 13 places in the alphabet (ROT13 cipher).
Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.

### 2. Base64 Encoding:

The output of the ROT13 encryption is then encoded into Base64 for additional obfuscation.

### 3. Custom Decryption (customDecrypt):

It first decodes the input text from Base64.
Then, it reverses the ROT13 shift to retrieve the original text.
This dual-layer approach is for simple obfuscation rather than robust cryptographic security.
